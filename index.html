								<h1>About me</h1>
								<p>
									I am currently a PhD candidate in Accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. I will be on the job market during the 2016-2017 academic year.
								</p>

								<p>
									My research interests span the areas of financial reporting, tax, political economy, and auditing, and I employ both analytical and empirical methods. My dissertation committee consists of Professors Maureen McNichols (chair), Anne Beyer, and Lisa De Simone.
								</p>

								<p>
									I was previously a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C. from 2011 to 2013 in the Research & Statistics division. I graduated from Yale in 2011 with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics.

							<h2><a href="assets/file/Raghunandan_JMP_14nov16.pdf" target="_blank">Government Subsidies and Corporate Fraud</a> <small>(Job Market Paper)</small></h2>

							<h3>Abstract:</h3>
							<p>
								I study the relation between firms' receipt of significant subsidies and their subsequent propensities to engage in -- and be caught engaging in -- financial fraud. Firms that receive subsidies are likely to have greater influence over the legislators who award these subsidies, relative to nonrecipient firms, but are also more likely to be subject to external scrutiny. I first develop a three-player model between a firm and two types of regulators that captures these tensions and empirically examine the model's main predictions. Consistent with regulatory capture, I find that firms receiving tax breaks tend to engage in fraud more frequently relative to nonrecipient firms. However, there is an inverse relation between the value of tax breaks that a firm receives and the likelihood that the firm engages in fraud. Conversely, firms that receive direct cash grants or below-market-rate access to resources do not on average engage in fraud any more or less frequently relative to firms that do not receive such grants. My findings provide insight into the relation between regulatory capture and financial fraud, and suggest that recent standard-setters' recommendations for additional subsidy disclosures by both governments and firms could provide useful information for both policymakers and investors.

							<h2>Misreporting and Regulatory Incentives</h2>
							<h3>Abstract:</h3>
							<p>
								I develop a model of regulatory behavior as it relates to earnings management. There is a self-interested regulator who may or may not wish to revolve to a higher-paying private-sector job. Whether or not he wants to do so, as well as his talent level and available resources, is his private information. The two types of regulators (revolvers and non-revolvers) face different decision problems. Revolvers would like to catch as much earnings management as possible in order to establish a track record (regardless of how much goes undetected). By contrast, non-revolvers would like for there to be as little undetected earnings management as possible, as this reflects poorly on them. I show that, unlike in the case with only one dimension of information asymmetry, there is a nontrivial disclosure equilibrium where the regulator reveals information for certain amounts of available resources. Despite the presence of the revolving door, allowing the regulator to selectively disclose leads to lower overall ex-ante expected earnings management.
